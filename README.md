**ðŸ’¸ Expense Tracker**
This is a responsive expense tracker web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any external libraries. The app allows you to track your income and expenses, view your balance, and manage your transactions easily.

**Functionality**

1.Dashboard
The dashboard shows three cards: Balance, Income, and Expenses. These values update automatically whenever transactions are added or deleted.

2.Add Transaction Form
The form includes fields for Amount, Description, Category (dropdown), and Date. When you submit the form, the transaction is added to the history and totals are updated.

3.Transaction History
All transactions are displayed dynamically in a history section. Each transaction shows its description, category, date, and amount. Every transaction also has a delete button to remove it.

4.Dynamic Updates
The application recalculates balance, income, and expenses in real time whenever a transaction is added or removed.

5.Local Storage
Transactions are stored in localStorage so they remain available even after refreshing the page.

6.Filtering and Search
You can filter transactions by category and search transactions by description.

7.Responsive Design
The design uses CSS Flexbox and Grid to make the layout responsive. On smaller screens, dashboard cards stack vertically, and the transaction history becomes scrollable.

Dark Mode
A dark mode toggle button is included. You can switch between light and dark themes using JavaScript and CSS.

Pie Chart (Optional)
An optional pie chart created with HTML canvas and JavaScript shows the distribution of expenses by category. The chart is responsive for both desktop and mobile.
